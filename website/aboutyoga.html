            <h2>Origin and Philosophy</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Yoga's origins can be traced back over 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest known systems of personal development. It has its roots in the Indian subcontinent, and the word "yoga" itself is derived from the Sanskrit word "yuj," which means to unite or join. This essence of unity is at the core of yoga's philosophy.

                At its heart, yoga is a spiritual practice that seeks to unify the individual self (Atman) with the universal consciousness (Brahman). It teaches us that beneath our physical bodies and restless minds, there is a deep, abiding connection that unites us all. Through various practices and techniques, yoga guides individuals on a path to self-realization and a deeper understanding of their true nature.</p>

            <p>The practice of yoga involves a dynamic interplay between the mind and body. Through meditation and mindfulness, practitioners learn to observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment, fostering greater self-awareness and emotional intelligence. This inward focus allows individuals to develop a greater sense of mental clarity and emotional balance, enabling them to approach life with greater poise and resilience.
